# Heritage-Health-Prize
My approach to the Heritage Health Prize competition organized by Kaggle.


This problem focuses on Data Manipulation and Feature Engineering. The data for this problem is available on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/c/hhp/data). Heritage Health Prize is a competition organized on Kaggle with data provided by Heritage Provider Network (HPN). According to the problem description on Kaggle “More than 71 million individuals in the United States are admitted to hospitals each year, according to the latest survey from the American Hospital Association. Studies have concluded that in 2006 well over $30 billion was spent on unnecessary hospital admissions. Is there a better way? Can we identify earlier those most at risk and ensure they get the treatment they need?”. So, the purpose of the challenge is to predict how many days a person will spend in the hospital next year. With this prediction, the cost of hospitalization should reduce and patients will receive treatment before they are needed to be hospitalized.
